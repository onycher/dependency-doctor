# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Dependency Doctor

## 1. Overview
Dependency Doctor is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the management of software dependencies. It streamlines the process of updating dependencies, analyzes the impact and risks of changes, inspects for security vulnerabilities, and uses AI to refactor codebases to accommodate breaking changes.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Reduce manual effort and errors in dependency management.
- Ensure projects remain secure and up-to-date.
- Minimize downtime and bugs caused by breaking changes.
- Provide actionable insights and automated code refactoring using AI.

## 3. Features & Functionality

### 3.1 Automated Dependency Updates
- Detect outdated dependencies in the project.
- Automatically update dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
- Generate pull requests or patches for updates.

### 3.2 Impact & Risk Analysis
- Analyze the impact of dependency updates on the codebase.
- Identify potential breaking changes and compatibility issues.
- Provide risk assessment reports for each update.

### 3.3 Dependency Security Inspection
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (using public databases like CVE, Snyk, etc.).
- Alert users to security risks and suggest remediation steps.

### 3.4 AI-Powered Code Refactoring
- Detect code areas affected by breaking changes.
- Use AI to refactor code automatically to resolve incompatibilities.
- Suggest or apply code changes with explanations.

## 4. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to automatically update my project dependencies so that I can keep my project up-to-date with minimal effort.
- As a project maintainer, I want to understand the risks and impacts of dependency updates before applying them.
- As a security-conscious user, I want to be alerted to vulnerabilities in my dependencies and receive guidance on how to fix them.
- As a developer, I want AI to help refactor my code when dependencies introduce breaking changes, so I can save time and avoid errors.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- Support for Python projects (initially, with possible future support for other languages).
- Integration with package managers (e.g., pip, uv).
- Use of AI models for code analysis and refactoring.
- Security scanning via public vulnerability databases.
- Modular architecture for easy extension.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Percentage of dependencies kept up-to-date.
- Number of vulnerabilities detected and resolved.
- Reduction in manual effort for dependency management.
- User satisfaction (via feedback or surveys).

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** AI-generated refactoring may introduce bugs.
  - **Mitigation:** Provide code review suggestions and require user approval before applying changes.
- **Risk:** False positives/negatives in security scanning.
  - **Mitigation:** Use multiple sources for vulnerability data and allow user overrides.
- **Risk:** Compatibility issues with complex projects.
  - **Mitigation:** Allow manual intervention and rollback options.
