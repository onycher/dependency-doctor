# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Dependency Doctor

## 1. Overview
Dependency Doctor is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the management of software dependencies for projects hosted on GitHub. By providing a repository URL, users can update dependencies, analyze the impact and risks of changes, inspect for security vulnerabilities, and use AI to refactor codebases to accommodate breaking changes.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Reduce manual effort and errors in dependency management.
- Ensure projects remain secure and up-to-date.
- Minimize downtime and bugs caused by breaking changes.
- Provide actionable insights and automated code refactoring using AI.

## 3. Features & Functionality

### 3.1 Automated Dependency Updates
- Detect outdated dependencies in a given GitHub repository.
- Automatically update dependencies to the latest compatible versions.
- Generate pull requests or patches for updates.

### 3.2 Impact & Risk Analysis
- Analyze the impact of dependency updates on the codebase of a GitHub repository.
- Identify potential breaking changes and compatibility issues.
- Provide risk assessment reports for each update.

### 3.3 Dependency Security Inspection
- Scan dependencies in a GitHub repository for known vulnerabilities (using public databases like CVE, Snyk, etc.).
- Alert users to security risks and suggest remediation steps.

### 3.4 AI-Powered Code Refactoring
- Detect code areas affected by breaking changes in a GitHub repository.
- Use AI to refactor code automatically to resolve incompatibilities.
- Suggest or apply code changes with explanations.

## 4. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to automatically update my project dependencies by providing a GitHub URL so that I can keep my project up-to-date with minimal effort.
- As a project maintainer, I want to understand the risks and impacts of dependency updates on my GitHub repository before applying them.
- As a security-conscious user, I want to be alerted to vulnerabilities in my GitHub repository's dependencies and receive guidance on how to fix them.
- As a developer, I want AI to help refactor my code when dependencies introduce breaking changes, so I can save time and avoid errors.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- Support for Python projects (initially, with possible future support for other languages).
- Integration with the GitHub API to fetch repository contents.
- Integration with package managers (e.g., pip, uv) via dependency file parsing.
- Use of AI models for code analysis and refactoring.
- Security scanning via public vulnerability databases.
- Modular architecture for easy extension.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Percentage of dependencies kept up-to-date.
- Number of vulnerabilities detected and resolved.
- Reduction in manual effort for dependency management.
- User satisfaction (via feedback or surveys).

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** AI-generated refactoring may introduce bugs.
  - **Mitigation:** Provide code review suggestions and require user approval before applying changes.
- **Risk:** False positives/negatives in security scanning.
  - **Mitigation:** Use multiple sources for vulnerability data and allow user overrides.
- **Risk:** Compatibility issues with complex projects.
  - **Mitigation:** Allow manual intervention and rollback options.
